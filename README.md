# git-tutorial

This is a quick little playground to understand git a little better.

We will need to put all pages of the book into a new branch that isn't yet created. Currently the master branch has the majority of the book, but another author has written page 3 and wants to put it into our book. You'll need to cherry-pick the main chunk of the book in master and also the branch with page 3 in it.

Merge conflicts to come!
